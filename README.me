Dungeons and Dragons Encounter

An application to assist in dungeons and dragons combat.

Users can search for monsters, save them to an encounter, and use the application to roll for the monsters and track damage.

An API request is made to https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/monsters/ to search for monster. 

A request is also made to the MongoDB backend server to have data persistent storage.
